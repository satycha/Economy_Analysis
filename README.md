Analyzing US economic trends over the years 
Introduction

Economic Growth can be best explained by examining five important sources of economic growth

Labour supply - The labor force is the number of people over the age of 16 who are either working or available for work but currently unemployed. It is affected by population growth, net immigration and the labor force participation rate.

Physical Capital Stock - A high rate of investment increases a country's stock of physical capital. As noted earlier, a larger capital stock increases labor productivity and potential GDP.

Technology - Improvements in technology increase productivity and potential GDP. More rapid improvements in technology lead to greater rates of economic growth.

Natural Resources - Raw material inputs, such as oil and land, are necessary to produce economic output. These resources may be renewable. Countries with large amounts of productive natural resources can achieve greater rates of economic growth

In developed countries, where a high level of capital per worker is available and capital inputs experience diminishing marginal productivity, technological advances that increase total factor productivity are the main sources of sustainable economic growth
It is also imprtant to analyze the human development index to ensure that the economic growth also improves HDI
Gapminder world datasets

        Following are the datasets that were onboarded.
        Total gdp inflation adjusted
        Income
        Inflation
        Interest Rate
        Population
        Labor Force
        Investment (% of GDP)
        Tax Revenue
        Natural Resources Rent
        R&D expenditure
        HDI
        High Tech Export

Out of these datasets, data for the US between the years 2005 to 2015 was extracted and combined to anlyze economic trends based on those indicators.
From this dataset we could try to solve following questions:

        Which year the HDI was highest and what were the correspondiong features for that HDI?
        What are the economic trends and which feature contributes the most for potential GDP growth?
        What were the features during the financial crash of 2007?
        How much did the economy grow between 2005 and 2015?
        fiscal vs monetary trends?
        Which measure (fiscal or monetary) was undertaken to control inflation?
        Is there correlation between various features?
        For the analysis included in the notebook, I have chosen to look at the following 4 questions:
        Which year the HDI was highest and what were the correspondiong features for that HDI?
        What are the economic trends and which feature contributes the most for potential gdp growth?
        What were the features during the financial crash of 2007 ?
        GDP change from 2005 to 2015?
